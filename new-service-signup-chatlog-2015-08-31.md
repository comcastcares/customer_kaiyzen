#Support Session Date: August 31st, 2015
##Reason: singing up for new service
###Session Length: ~3 hrs
###Support Rep: Ashley (#4221458)

Notes:

Looks like rep finally dropped off around the 3 hr mark even though session still active.  Still received zero package details, did get one offer from the rep to provide a link to online pages where I could research options that might fit my needs.  Ended doing two phone sessions and signing up on a no-term contract.

You: "You: would like to start with the pro plus w/ X1 as base"
You: so looks like that package isn't "available in my area"

Check traffic, view your daily horoscope, or see your weather forecast, all with the touch of a button.
